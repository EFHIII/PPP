# Test
This is an experimental Steno practice program. To use the program, you need a [Plover](https://www.openstenoproject.org/plover/) compatible stenotype and [Plover](https://www.openstenoproject.org/plover/). In Plover, disable all dictionaries when using this program. The program is available at [https://efhiii.github.io/ppp](https://efhiii.github.io/ppp)

## About the program
Within the program is currently a single test lesson that serves as a proof-of-concept. It is the only screen you see. Provided development continues, there will later be an interface to choose lessons. When doing a lesson, you use a stenotype to type the text shown. If a mistake is made, the intended stroke will be shown until you correctly stroke the word/phrase.

## Lessons format
Each line consists of arbitrary text followed by the steno that results in that output.

To produce that steno, just like when using the program itself, it is easiest to use Plover with all dictionaries disabled.
